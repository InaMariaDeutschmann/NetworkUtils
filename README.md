NetworkUtils
============

NetworkUtils is a collection of functions used to perform the simulations in the publication "From hairballs to hypotheses - biological insights from microbial networks" (Rottjers and Faust 2018). Most of the functions are wrappers, either to wrap tool output to convenient adjacency matrices, or to support analyses on these matrices. Note that this code has mostly been placed online as supporting material for the publication, and its functionality cannot be guaranteed.

For a brief introduction on function usage, check out <a href="https://ramellose.github.io/NetworkUtils/articles/testing_network_tools.html"> this vignette. </a> A lot of the code in this repo is not meant for reuse, and is therefore redundant and not well-documented. If you would like to see more detailed documentation or have specific questions answered, feel free to open an issue.
